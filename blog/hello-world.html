                    I finally got around to making myself a website! What now?
                    To be honest, I didn't really have much of a plan in mind.
                    I've seen lots of cool blogs and portfolios over the past
                    several years and thought GitHub Pages seemed pretty neat,
                    so I eventually bit the bullet and set the repository up.
                </p>
                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    I've written relatively simple HTML and CSS several times
                    before, but that was more for throwaway projects that
                    wouldn't see the light of day. My goal with this site was to
                    make it good-looking, accessible, idiomatic, and relatively
                    simple. Despite its current minimalism, working on it
                    reminded me of why I don't really enjoy web development that
                    much. I think it's the whole designing aspect compounded
                    with how I can't stop impulsively overthinking every little
                    detail. However, I've learned a lot more about HTML and CSS
                    in addition to also developing a sort of taste or internal
                    sense of standards for how I'd like my code to be written.
                    It just seems to me like there's an unlimited number of ways
                    for doing the same thing in web development too, and it's
                    pretty frusturating for me. I hope that the more I read and
                    practice, the easier it'll be for me to just write things
                    out without much bikeshedding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also not very knowledgable when it comes to UI design,
                    accessibility, typography, and the like. They all scare me,
                    but I feel like it's a good thing that I've read about them
                    all to try to do what I can, instead of just avoiding them.
                    Maybe it'll all help me later on in other areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is also probably the first time that I've seriously
                    used AI throughout working on a project. I'm not using it to
                    the extent where it's embedded in my editor and allowed to
                    modify files, or even where I'm just copying and pasting
                    code. So far, I've primarily been using it for learning
                    about the different ways of implementing things, and
                    assistance with decision-making. I chose Grok because its
                    lack of apparent censorship in comparison to other models
                    stood out nicely. I also want to check out Zed's AI features
                    later on when I become a bit more confident with programming
                    again. I don't, however, see myself using AI for prose.
                </p>
                <h2>Content</h2>
                <p>
                    As for the content of the site itself, I feel like it's
                    going to go through a lot of changes over time, as I'm quick
                    to change my mind. For now, I'm thinking of it having some
                    information about myself, a portfolio (despite my limited
                    prowess), and my projects on GitHub, all on the front page.
                    Later on, I can split things up into more pages if needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the blog, I hope that over time I write a bunch of
                    posts about all the different things that comes to my mind.
                    Some topics that I can see being written about currently
                    include programming, Linux, metal, weightlifting,
                    philosophy, and me trying to navigate life. Regarding the
                    ability to stay consistent with posting, I'm not sure if I
                    can make any guarantees, but I'll try my best. I won't lie,
                    attention from the internet on what I write would be a
                    substantial motivation.
                </p>
                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>
                    Since starting high school, I've dropped off considerably
                    with being a computer nerd and all. I think it was some
                    combination of me being distracted, being unmotivated, not
                    having time, and falling into procrastination. However now
                    that it's summer break, I've really been getting back into
                    the habit of programming and messing around with my system.
                    I've also uploaded a lot of old projects lying around on my
                    computers up to GitHub after some refactoring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the first relatively major project I've written in
                    quite a while, and it's also something that I'm a bit
                    unfamiliar with (web development). I hope that I follow
                    through with working on this, and in the process also learn
                    about web development and writing prose.
